## **Abstract**

The paper investigates the Storytelling of Luxury Brands on Social Media. Data Science methods were employed to identify specificities of the industry and similarities between brands. The objective was to look at the role of brands communication in enhancing their brand image and identity on the market.

The research of this paper includes Similarity Networks, Sentiment Analysis, and Advanced Natural Language Processing tasks such as Predictive Analysis and Topic Modeling. A lot of time has also been dedicated to Data Transformation, Preprocessing, and Visualization of the models deployed.

The paper concludes that the Storytelling of Luxury Brands has a major role in shaping the market and guiding the clients. Two Luxury Brands operating on the same products may not compete, displaying a completely different Communication Strategy. Finally, we have seen that Luxury Brands can adapt their storytelling regarding the target public without threatening their image.

While TextBlob and Vader sentiment analysis helped us get an overview of the market storytelling, we got the finest results from Eli5 and TDA models. Further research must be done in this direction, especially on a way of incorporating a specific luxury lexicon, clients communication, and other prediction models.

The Luxury Market is in constant transformation and a new brand could disrupt the sector with a strong storytelling strategy. We hope this analysis will help managers to have a better understanding of one of the major aspects of Luxury Marketing.
